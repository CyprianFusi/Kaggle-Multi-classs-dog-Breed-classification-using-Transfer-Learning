# Kaggle-Multi-classs-dog-Breed-classification-using-Transfer-Learning
An end-to-end multi-class classification model for classifying dogs' breed using pre-trained model

This repo contains two notebooks - one was for experimental purpose before tackling the main project while the second is an **end-to-end multi-class dogs' breed classification model using Tensorflow and Transfer Learning** approach.
In the experimental notebook, I used just `1000` samples of the data while the main notebook used all the more than `10k` dataset for training and an equally more than `10k` dataset for testing. This is a previous Kaggle competion without labels for the test dataset.
